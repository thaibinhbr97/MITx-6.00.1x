# Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

### About This Course
This course is the first of a two-course sequence: [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-10), and [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computational-thinking-data-mitx-6-00-2x-5). Together, they are designed to help people with no prior experience to Computer Science and Programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses.

### What You'll Learn
 - A Notion of computation  
 - The Python programming language  
 - Some simple algorithms  
 - Testing and debugging  
 - An informal introduction to algorithmic complexity  
 - Data structures
